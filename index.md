**[MICCAI 25] MvHo-IB: Multi-View High-Order Information Bottleneck for Brain Disorder Diagnosis**  
[[Paper]](https://papers.miccai.org/miccai-2025/paper/0646_paper.pdf) [[Code]](https://github.com/zky04/MvHo-IB)  
**Kunyu Zhang**, Qiang Li, Shujian Yu  
We propose a novel method to capture higher-order interactions while using information bottleneck to reduce redundancy between multi-view information for brain disorder diagnosis.

**[Briefings in Bioinformatics] ProtoMol: Enhancing Molecular Property Prediction via Prototype-Guided Multimodal Learning**  
[[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.16824) [[Code]](https://github.com/zky04/Protomol)  
Yingxu Wang\*, **Kunyu Zhang**\*, Jiaxin Huang, Nan Yin, Siwei Liu, Eran Segal  
We propose ProtoMol, a prototype-guided multimodal framework that hierarchically aligns molecular graphs and textual descriptions via layer-wise cross-modal attention and a shared prototype space, consistently outperforming prior methods on molecular property prediction while improving interpretability.

**[arXiv] Clinical Expert Uncertainty Guided Generalized Label Smoothing for Medical Noisy Label Learning**
[[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02495) [[Code]](https://github.com/zky04/Medical-Noisy-Label-Dataset)
**Kunyu Zhang**, Lin Gu, Liangchen Liu, Yingke Chen, Bingyang Wang, Jin Yan, Yingying Zhu
We address label noise in medical image datasets caused by clinical expert uncertainty in diagnostic notes. We propose a clinical expert uncertainty-aware benchmark and a label smoothing method that significantly outperforms current approaches.

**[arXiv] EVA-Net: Interpretable Anomaly Detection for Brain Health via Learning Continuous Aging Prototypes from One-Class EEG Cohorts**
[[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.15393) [[Code]](https://github.com/zky04/EVA-Net)
**Kunyu Zhang**, Mingxuan Wang, Xiangjie Shi, Haoxing Xu, Chao Zhang
We propose EVA-Net to capture multi-scale temporal dependencies in long EEG sequences while leveraging a variational information bottleneck and continuous prototype alignment to learn an interpretable healthy manifold for brain health anomaly detection.

**[Neural Networks] Heterogeneity-aware high-efficiency federated learning with hybrid synchronous-asynchronous splitting strategy**
[[Paper]](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0893608025009189)
Zijian Li\*, Boyuan Li\*, **Kunyu Zhang**, Bingcai Wei, Hongbo Liu, Zihan Chen, Xinqiang Xie, Tony Q.S. Quek
We propose a resource-aware adaptive model customization mechanism that mixes synchronous edge feature extraction with asynchronous global classifier updates, achieving faster convergence, higher accuracy, and lower network traffic.

**[arXiv] MoE-GraphSAGE-Based Integrated Evaluation of Transient Rotor Angle and Voltage Stability in Power Systems**
[[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.08610)
**Kunyu Zhang**, Guang Yang, Fashun Shi, Shaoying He, Yuchi Zhang
We propose a MoE-GraphSAGE-based framework that enables integrated evaluation of transient rotor angle and voltage stability in power systems.

**[TIA] Multi-microgrids Peer to Peer Electricity-carbon joint Trading Method Based on Multi-agent Ethical Enhancement Technology**
[[Paper]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/11196024/)
Fashun Shi, Lin Cheng, Yuguang Song, Pengjie Zhao, Yufei Xi, **Kunyu Zhang**, Haiwang Zhong
We propose a peer-to-peer (P2P) electricity-carbon joint trading method based on multi-agent ethical enhancement technology that combines safe reinforcement learning with a privacy protection module, achieving low-carbon economic operation for multi-microgrids while adhering to "do-no-harm" and "privacy protection" ethical principles.
