# üë®‚Äçüî¨ About Me
I am an aspiring researcher passionate about harnessing deep learning to drive innovation in healthcare and medicine. My work focuses on applying deep learning to address complex medical challenges and improve patient outcomes.

Currently, I am exploring a range of AI applications in healthcare, including medical image analysis, clinical decision support systems, and predictive modeling for disease diagnosis and treatment. Beyond medicine, I am also committed to developing flexible, efficient, and generalizable deep learning methodologies applicable across diverse scientific domains.

**[arXiv] Clinical Expert Uncertainty Guided Generalized Label Smoothing for Medical Noisy Label Learning**  
[[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02495) [[Code]](https://github.com/zky04/Medical-Noisy-Label-Dataset)  
**Kunyu Zhang**, Lin Gu, Liangchen Liu, Yingke Chen, Bingyang Wang, Jin Yan, Yingying Zhu  
We address label noise in medical image datasets caused by clinical expert uncertainty in diagnostic notes. We propose a clinical expert uncertainty-aware benchmark and a label smoothing method that significantly outperforms current approaches.

**[MICCAI 25] MvHo-IB: Multi-View High-Order Information Bottleneck for Brain Disorder Diagnosis**  
[[Paper]](https://papers.miccai.org/miccai-2025/paper/0646_paper.pdf) [[Code]](https://github.com/zky04/MvHo-IB)  
**Kunyu Zhang**, Qiang Li, Shujian Yu  
We propose a novel method to capture higher-order interactions while using information bottleneck to reduce redundancy between multi-view information for brain disorder diagnosis.
