This paper proposes a resource-aware adaptive model customization mechanism for federated learning that achieves faster convergence, higher accuracy, and lower network traffic.

**Key Contributions:**
- Adapt resource-aware adaptive model customization mechanism tailor suitable model
- Mix synchronous edge feature extraction with asynchronous global classifier updates  
- Use baseline-prioritized weighted aggregation to balance model update directions
- Achieve faster convergence, higher accuracy, and lower network traffic
