This work proposes a peer-to-peer (P2P) electricity–carbon joint trading method for multi-microgrids based on multi-agent ethical enhancement technology. By combining safe reinforcement learning with a privacy protection module, the method achieves low-carbon economic operation while adhering to the ethical principles of "do-no-harm" and "privacy protection".
