## About Me

I am an aspiring researcher passionate about harnessing deep learning to drive innovation in healthcare and medicine. My work focuses on applying deep learning to address complex medical challenges and improve patient outcomes.

Currently, I am exploring a range of AI applications in healthcare, including medical image analysis, clinical decision support systems, and predictive modeling for disease diagnosis and treatment. Beyond medicine, I am also committed to developing flexible, efficient, and generalizable deep learning methodologies applicable across diverse scientific domains.

## Research Interests

- **AI in Biomedicine**: Applying artificial intelligence across biomedical domains, including but not limited to neuroscience, medical imaging, clinical diagnosis, and prognosis

- **Machine Learning for Health**: Investigating the adaptability and limitations of machine learning methods in biomedical research

- **Generalizable AI Methodologies**: Exploring the theoretical foundations for extending AI from biomedical applications to other scientific disciplines through flexible, low-cost, and efficient deep learning frameworks

## Publications

### [MICCAI 2025] MvHo-IB: Multi-View High-Order Information Bottleneck for Brain Disorder Diagnosis
**Kunyu Zhang**, Qiang Li, Shujian Yu  
[[Paper]](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02847) [[Code]](https://github.com/zky04/MvHo-IB)

We propose a novel method to capture higher-order interactions while using information bottleneck to reduce redundancy between multi-view information for brain disorder diagnosis.

### [arXiv] Clinical Expert Uncertainty Guided Generalized Label Smoothing for Medical Noisy Label Learning  
**Kunyu Zhang**, Lin Gu, Liangchen Liu, Yingke Chen, Bingyang Wang, Jin Yan, Yingying Zhu  
[[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.02495) [[Code]](https://github.com/zky04/Medical-Noisy-Label-Dataset)

We address label noise in medical image datasets caused by clinical expert uncertainty in diagnostic notes. We propose a clinical expert uncertainty-aware benchmark and a label smoothing method that significantly outperforms current approaches.
